A biblioteca bo-lib contém componentes personalizados baseados nos componentes do PO-UI.\n🗂️ Estrutura do Projeto\nExemplo :bo-lib/\n lib\n  components\n   drilldown\n   export-button\nng-package.json\npackage.json\nREADME.md\ntsconfig.lib.json\ntsconfig.lib.prod.json\ntsconfig.spec.json⚙️ Instalação\nPara instalar as dependências do projeto, execute:\nnpm install\nnpm install chart.js@^4.4.7 file-saver@^2.0.5 jspdf@^2.5.2 jspdf-autotable@^3.8.4 --force\nnpm install @backoffice/bo-lib --registry https://npm.totvs.io --force\n🚀 Servidor de Desenvolvimento\nVocê irá precisar de um ambiente válido que já execute corretamente o PO-UI, caso tenha alguma dúvida em relação a instalação do PO-UI consulte a documentação oficial aqui PO-UI\nPara visualizar em tempo real suas mudanças na lib use:\nng build bo-lib --watch\n🏗️ Build da biblioteca\nPara construir a biblioteca bo-lib, execute:\nng build bo-lib\n📦 Publicação\nA publicação é feita através do CI/CD do drone após versionamento e geração de tag do repositório. Baseado na master.\n🧪 Execução de Testes Unitários\nPara executar os testes unitários via Karma, execute:\nng test --project=bo-lib\n🛠️ Comandos\nPara gerar um novo componente, execute:\nng generate component components/{comonent-name} --project=bo-lib\nVocê também pode usar\nng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project=bo-lib\n📖 Gerar documentação Compodoc\n npx compodoc -p projects/bo-lib/tsconfig.lib.json -d projects/bo-lib/documentation --language=pt-BR --name='Backoffice Lib Docs'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         resultados correspondentes \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        Nenhum resultado correspondente \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Módulos\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         resultados correspondentes \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        Nenhum resultado correspondente \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Visão geral\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    4 Componentes\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    3 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         resultados correspondentes \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        Nenhum resultado correspondente \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Propriedades\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 0.0.0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         resultados correspondentes \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        Nenhum resultado correspondente \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
